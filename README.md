# AI-Code-Generator
**Project Description**

An AI-powered code generation tool that uses Hugging Face Transformers to generate functional code snippets from natural language inputs. The model is fine-tuned for improved performance and deployed through a Gradio interface, allowing users to interact with the model in real time.

**Key Features**

Accepts plain English prompts and returns relevant, executable code.

Fine-tuned transformer model for improved accuracy and contextual understanding.

Seamless Gradio UI for interactive web-based usage.

Supports common programming tasks like loops, functions, conditionals, etc.
